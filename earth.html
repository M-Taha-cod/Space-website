            <h1 class="heading">Earth Story</h1>
            
            <p class="er-toptext">The Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a massive cloud of dust and gas left over from the birth of the Sun. This process is part of what's known as the Nebular Hypothesis, which explains how the planets in our Solar System came into existence. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how Earth formed:</p>
    
            <h2 class="er-topics">1. The Solar Nebula (4.6 billion years ago)</h2>
            <ul class="er-topicstexts">
                <li>The Solar System started as a giant rotating cloud of gas and dust, called the solar nebula.</li>
                <li>Gravity caused the cloud to collapse in on itself, forming the Sun at its center.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2 class="er-topics">2. Formation of Planetary Disk</h2>
            <ul class="er-topicstexts">
                <li>The remaining gas and dust began swirling around the Sun in a flattened disk.</li>
                <li>Tiny dust particles started sticking together due to static electricity, forming small clumps.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2 class="er-topics">3. Planetesimals and Protoplanets (4.5 billion years ago)</h2>
            <ul class="er-topicstexts">
                <li>Small clumps of dust and rock collided and stuck together, growing into planetesimals (small planetary building blocks).</li>
                <li>Over time, these planetesimals continued colliding, forming larger bodies called protoplanets.</li>
                <li>One of these protoplanets became the early Earth.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2 class="er-topics">4. The Birth of Earth</h2>
            <ul class="er-topicstexts">
                <li>Gravity pulled in more material, making Earth grow bigger and very hot due to constant collisions.</li>
                <li>The heat melted much of the planet, allowing heavy metals like iron and nickel to sink to the center, forming Earth’s core.</li>
                <li>Lighter materials rose to the surface, forming the crust.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2 class="er-topics">5. The Moon’s Formation (~4.5 billion years ago)</h2>
            <ul class="er-topicstexts">
                <li>A Mars-sized object, called Theia, collided with Earth.</li>
                <li>The impact blasted debris into space, which eventually came together to form the Moon.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2 class="er-topics">6. Cooling and Atmosphere Formation (~4.4 billion years ago)</h2>
            <ul class="er-topicstexts">
                <li>As Earth cooled, volcanoes released gases like water vapor, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen, forming the early atmosphere.</li>
                <li>Water vapor condensed, leading to rain and the formation of the first oceans.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2 class="er-topics">7. First Life (~3.5 billion years ago)</h2>
            <ul class="er-topicstexts">
                <li>Simple life forms, such as bacteria, appeared in the oceans.</li>
                <li>Over billions of years, life evolved, leading to plants, animals, and eventually humans.</li>
            </ul>
