            <h1 class="heading">MERCURY</h1>

            <p class="mer-toptext">Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System, orbiting closest to the Sun. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury has a fascinating set of characteristics that make it a subject of significant scientific interest. Here is a comprehensive overview of Mercury:</p>

            <h2>Discovery and Basics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Discovery: Mercury has been known since ancient times and is visible to the naked eye. It was observed by various ancient civilizations, including the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Greeks.</li>
                <li>Orbit and Rotation: Mercury orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 57.91 million kilometers (35.98 million miles). It has the shortest orbital period of any planet, completing an orbit every 88 Earth days. Mercury has a slow rotation period, taking about 59 Earth days to complete one rotation, resulting in a unique 3:2 spin-orbit resonance (it rotates three times for every two orbits around the Sun).</li>   
            </ul>

            <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Size and Mass: Mercury has a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles), making it slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Its mass is approximately 3.30 × 10^23 kilograms, about 5.5% of Earth's mass.</li>
                <li>Surface: Mercury's surface is heavily cratered and resembles the Moon's surface. It features extensive plains, cliffs (called scarps), and impact craters. The planet's surface is also marked by large basins, such as the Caloris Basin, one of the largest impact features in the Solar System.</li>
                <li>Albedo: Mercury has a low albedo (reflectivity) of about 0.11, meaning it reflects only 11% of the sunlight that hits it. This low reflectivity is due to its dark, rocky surface.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Internal Structure</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Core: Mercury has a large, metallic core that makes up about 55% of its volume. The core is believed to be partially molten and is composed primarily of iron and nickel.</li>
                <li>Mantle and Crust: Surrounding the core is a silicate mantle and a thin, rocky crust. The mantle is relatively thin compared to the core, and the crust is estimated to be about 100 kilometers (62 miles) thick.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Exosphere: Mercury has a very thin and tenuous exosphere, composed mainly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. This exosphere is not a true atmosphere because it is so thin and does not provide significant protection from solar radiation or meteoroid impacts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Surface Conditions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Temperature: Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations due to its lack of a substantial atmosphere. Daytime temperatures can reach up to 430°C (800°F), while nighttime temperatures can drop to -180°C (-290°F).</li>
                <li>Surface Pressure: The surface pressure is negligible, effectively a vacuum.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Magnetic Field</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Magnetic Field: Mercury has a weak magnetic field, about 1% the strength of Earth's magnetic field. This magnetic field is generated by the dynamo effect in its partially molten core.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Exploration and Missions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Mariner 10: The first spacecraft to visit Mercury, Mariner 10, conducted flybys in 1974 and 1975, providing the first close-up images and data on the planet's surface and magnetic field.</li>
                <li>MESSENGER: NASA's MESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) mission orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015, providing detailed maps of the planet's surface, composition, and magnetic field. It discovered evidence of water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles.</li>
                <li>BepiColombo: A joint mission by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), BepiColombo was launched in 2018 and is expected to arrive at Mercury in 2025. It aims to study the planet's surface, magnetic field, and exosphere in greater detail</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Scientific Significance</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Planetary Formation: Studying Mercury helps scientists understand the processes involved in the formation and evolution of terrestrial planets.</li>
                <li>Geology: Mercury's surface features, such as impact craters and scarps, provide insights into the planet's geological history and the effects of impacts and tectonic activity.</li>
                <li>Magnetic Field: The presence of a magnetic field on a small, slowly rotating planet like Mercury challenges existing theories of planetary magnetic field generation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future Exploration</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Proposed Missions: Future missions may include more detailed studies of Mercury's surface, interior, and magnetic field, potentially involving landers or rovers to explore the planet's surface directly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Mercury continues to be a subject of scientific interest due to its unique characteristics and the insights it provides into the formation and evolution of the Solar System. Despite its harsh environment, the planet offers valuable opportunities for advancing our understanding of planetary science.</h4>
