            <p class="mars-toptext">Mars, often referred to as the "Red Planet," is the fourth planet from the Sun and one of the most studied objects in the Solar System. It has captivated human imagination for centuries due to its potential for past or present life and its similarities to Earth. Here is a comprehensive overview of Mars, covering its discovery, physical characteristics, atmosphere, surface features, moons, exploration, and scientific significance.</p>

            <h2>Discovery and Basics</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Discovery: Mars has been known since ancient times and is visible to the naked eye. It was observed by ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Greeks.</li>
                <li>Orbit and Rotation:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Orbital Distance: Mars orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 227.9 million kilometers (141.6 million miles), or 1.52 astronomical units (AU).</li>
                    <li>Orbital Period: It takes Mars about 687 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun.</li>
                    <li>Rotation Period: Mars rotates on its axis once every 24.6 hours, giving it a day length (called a "sol") very similar to Earth's.</li>
                    <li>Axial Tilt: Mars has an axial tilt of 25.2 degrees, which is similar to Earth's, resulting in distinct seasons.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
