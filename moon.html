            <p class="moon-toptext">The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, has been a subject of human fascination and study for millennia. Here's a comprehensive overview of its characteristics, phases, and recent scientific discoveries.</p>

            <h2>Basic Characteristics:</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Diameter: Approximately 3,474 kilometers (2,159 miles).</li>
                <li>Average Distance from Earth: About 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles).</li>
                <li>Orbital Period: Roughly 27.3 days to complete one orbit around Earth.</li>
                <li>Rotation Period: Synchronously rotates with its orbit, resulting in the same side always facing Earth</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Lunar Phases:</h2>

            <p>The Moon progresses through a series of phases over approximately 29.5 days, known as the lunar cycle:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>New Moon: The Moon lies between Earth and the Sun, making it invisible from Earth.</li>
                <li>Waxing Crescent: A sliver of the Moon becomes visible as it moves away from the Sun's alignment.</li>
                <li>First Quarter: Half of the Moon's disk is illuminated.</li>
                <li>Waxing Gibbous: More than half is illuminated, approaching full illumination.</li>
                <li>Full Moon: The entire face of the Moon is illuminated, as it sits opposite the Sun relative to Earth.</li>
                <li>Waning Gibbous: The illuminated portion begins to decrease.</li>
                <li>Last Quarter: Half of the disk is illuminated, opposite side from the First Quarter.</li>
                <li>Waning Crescent: A decreasing sliver remains illuminated, leading back to the New Moon.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>These phases result from the Moon's changing position relative to Earth and the Sun.</p>

            <h2>Recent Scientific Discoveries:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ancient Volcanism: Samples obtained by China's Chang'e-6 mission from the Moon's far side have revealed evidence of prolonged volcanic activity, with basalt fragments dating back 4.2 billion and 2.8 billion years. This suggests that the Moon's far side was geologically active for at least 1.4 billion years. </li>
                <li>Color Variations: New images from the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) have shown that the Moon exhibits subtle color differences, with hues of blue and red observed on its surface. These variations are linked to different compositions of lunar basalts and lava flows.</li>
                <li>Lunar Caves: Scientists have discovered a 330-foot-deep cave beneath the Moon's Sea of Tranquillity. This underground cave, an empty lava tube, provides stable temperatures and protection from radiation, making it a potential site for future lunar bases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Observing the Moon:</h2>

            <p>For those interested in observing the Moon's phases, rise and set times, and position in the sky, several resources are available:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Time and Date's Moon Calculator: Provides detailed information on moonrise, moonset, and phase data for any location.</li>
                <li>NASA's Daily Moon Guide: Offers an interactive map for observing the Moon each day of the year.</li>
                <li>MoonCalc: Shows the motion of the Moon and its phase for a particular day at a specific location. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>These tools can enhance your lunar observation experience by providing accurate and timely information.</p>

            <h4>The Moon continues to be a focal point for scientific research and exploration, offering insights into planetary formation, geological processes, and the potential for future human habitation beyond Earth.</h4>
