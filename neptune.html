            <h1 class="nep-toptext">NEPTUNE</h1>

            <p class="nep-toptext">Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is a gas giant, known for its striking blue color and dynamic atmosphere. Here is a comprehensive overview of Neptune, covering its discovery, physical characteristics, atmosphere, moons, rings, exploration, and scientific significance.</p>

            <h2>Discovery and Basics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Discovery: Neptune was discovered on September 23, 1846, by German astronomer Johann Galle, based on mathematical predictions by French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier and British mathematician John Couch Adams. It was the first planet discovered through mathematical calculations rather than direct observation.</li>
                <li>Orbit and Rotation:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Orbital Distance: Neptune orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles), or 30.1 astronomical units (AU).</li>
                    <li>Orbital Period: It takes Neptune about 165 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun.</li>
                    <li>Rotation Period: Neptune rotates on its axis once every 16 hours, giving it a relatively short day compared to its long year.</li>
                    <li>Axial Tilt: Neptune has an axial tilt of 28.3 degrees, similar to Earth's, which results in seasonal changes.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Size and Mass:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diameter: Neptune has a diameter of about 49,244 kilometers (30,598 miles), making it the fourth-largest planet by diameter.</li>
                    <li>Mass: Neptune's mass is approximately 1.02 × 10^26 kilograms, or about 17 times the mass of Earth.</li>
                    <li>Density: Neptune has a density of 1.64 g/cm³, making it the densest of the gas giants.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Composition: Neptune is primarily composed of hydrogen (80%), helium (19%), and trace amounts of methane (1%). The methane in its atmosphere absorbs red light, giving Neptune its characteristic blue color.</li>
                <li>Internal Structure:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Atmosphere: The upper atmosphere consists of hydrogen, helium, and methane.</li>
                    <li>Mantle: Beneath the atmosphere lies a mantle of water, ammonia, and methane ices under high pressure and temperature.</li>
                    <li>Core: Neptune likely has a small, rocky core composed of silicates and metals, with a mass roughly equal to Earth's</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Composition: Neptune's atmosphere is primarily hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of methane, which gives the planet its blue color.</li>
                <li>Weather and Storms:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Neptune has the strongest winds in the Solar System, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour (1,300 mph).</li>
                    <li>The planet is known for its Great Dark Spot, a massive storm system similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The Great Dark Spot observed by Voyager 2 in 1989 had disappeared by the time the Hubble Space Telescope observed Neptune in the 1990s, indicating the dynamic nature of Neptune's atmosphere.</li>
                    <li>Other notable features include bright cirrus-like clouds made of methane ice and smaller storm systems.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Temperature: The average temperature in Neptune's upper atmosphere is about -214°C (-353°F), making it one of the coldest places in the Solar System.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>Neptune has 14 known moons, the largest of which is Triton. Here are some key details:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Triton:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Triton is Neptune's largest moon, with a diameter of 2,710 kilometers (1,680 miles).</li>
                    <li>It is unique because it orbits Neptune in a retrograde direction (opposite to Neptune's rotation), suggesting it was captured by Neptune's gravity.</li>
                    <li>Triton has a thin atmosphere and a surface covered in nitrogen ice and geysers that erupt nitrogen gas.</li>
                    <li>It is one of the few geologically active moons in the Solar System.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Other Moons:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The other moons are much smaller and include Proteus, Nereid, Larissa, and Despina, among others.</li>
                    <li>Many of these moons are irregularly shaped and likely captured objects.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2>Rings</h2>
            <p>Neptune has a faint ring system composed of five main rings:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Galle Ring: The innermost ring, named after Johann Galle.</li>
                <li>Le Verrier Ring: A narrow ring named after Urbain Le Verrier.</li>
                <li>Lassell Ring: A broad, faint ring.</li>
                <li>Arago Ring: A faint ring named after François Arago.</li>
                <li>Adams Ring: The outermost and most prominent ring, known for its arcs (clumps of dust) named Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, and Courage.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The rings are composed of dust and ice particles and are much fainter than Saturn's rings.</p>

            <h2>Exploration and Missions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Formation and Evolution: Studying Neptune helps scientists understand the formation and evolution of ice giants, which are common in exoplanetary systems.</li>
                <li>Atmospheric Dynamics: Neptune's extreme weather and storms provide insights into atmospheric processes on gas giants.</li>
                <li>Triton's Uniqueness: Triton's retrograde orbit and geological activity make it a key target for understanding the dynamics of captured moons and cryovolcanism.</li>
                <li>Ring Systems: Neptune's faint rings and their arcs offer clues about the formation and stability of planetary ring systems.</li>
            </ul>
