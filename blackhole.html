            <h1 class="heading">BLACK HOLE</h1>

            <p class="bhk-toptext">Black holes are among the most enigmatic and captivating objects in the universe. They are regions in space where an enormous amount of mass is packed into a tiny volume, creating a gravitational pull so strong that not even light can escape.</p>
            
            <h2>Formation of Black Holes:</h2>

            <p>Black holes are formed when massive stars exhaust their nuclear fuel and collapse under their own gravity. This collapse results in a singularity, a point of infinite density, surrounded by an event horizon—the boundary beyond which nothing can escape.</p>

            <h2>Types of Black Holes:</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Stellar Black Holes: Formed from the gravitational collapse of massive stars, these have masses ranging from about three to dozens of times that of our sun.</li>
                <li>Intermediate-Mass Black Holes: Heavier than stellar black holes but lighter than supermassive ones, these have masses between a few hundred to several thousand solar masses. Their existence was confirmed through observations of gravitational waves and other astrophysical phenomena.</li>
                <li>Supermassive Black Holes: Found at the centers of most galaxies, including our Milky Way, these giants have masses ranging from millions to billions of times that of the sun. Their formation processes are still under investigation, with theories suggesting they may grow by accreting matter and merging with other black holes.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Structure of Black Holes:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Event Horizon: The boundary surrounding a black hole beyond which nothing can escape. Once crossed, matter and radiation are inevitably drawn inward.</li>
                <li>Singularity: The core of a black hole where matter is thought to be infinitely dense and the laws of physics as currently understood cease to apply.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Detection of Black Holes:</h2>
            
            <p>Despite being invisible, black holes can be detected by their interactions with surrounding matter. As they accrete gas and dust, the material heats up and emits X-rays before crossing the event horizon. Additionally, the gravitational influence of black holes on nearby stars and light provides indirect evidence of their presence.</p>

            <h2>Recent Discoveries:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Rapid Growth of Primordial Black Holes: Observations from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope have revealed that supermassive black holes existed in the early universe much earlier than previously thought. One particular black hole, LID-568, from about 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang, is found to have a mass around 10 million times that of our sun. The rapid growth rate of LID-568 challenges existing models, as it is consuming material at over 40 times the Eddington limit, a theoretical maximum for how fast black holes can grow.</li>
                <li>Newly Discovered Intermediate-Mass Black Hole: Scientists have discovered a new black hole behind the star cluster Omega Centauri that may be the closest one to Earth. This black hole, with a mass at least 8,200 times that of our Sun, had previously eluded detection. The discovery was made using over 500 images from two decades of observations by the Hubble Space Telescope. Seven fast-moving stars near the cluster's center appeared to be influenced by the black hole's gravity. This black hole is thought to be an intermediate-mass black hole, serving as the missing link in the evolution of stellar black holes into supermassive black holes.</li>
                <li>Gentle Formation of a Black Hole: Astronomers have discovered a unique black hole in the constellation Cygnus, about 7,800 light-years from Earth, which may have formed via a gentle process rather than the violent supernova explosion typically associated with black hole creation. This black hole, named V404 Cygni, is part of a rare triple system, gravitationally bound to two ordinary stars. The researchers suspect a calmer formation because the system would have likely broken apart if the black hole had been produced by a supernova explosion. Instead, a direct collapse of the star's core after it exhausted its fuel may have resulted in a "failed supernova," leading to an implosion without an explosive event. This black hole, nine times the mass of the sun, is currently consuming material from one of its companion stars, which orbits it every 6.5 days.</li>
            </ul>
